# Measurement vs Control: The Critical Distinction

## Why This Matters

The same mathematics can measure reality OR enforce conformity.

This framework chooses **measurement**.

## The Difference

### Measurement System (What We Built)
```python
# 1. Observe reality
M_S = calculate_coherence(system)
energy = measure_energy_cost(system)

# 2. Calculate efficiency
efficiency = M_S / energy

# 3. Report truth
print(f"This system creates {efficiency:.2f} value per kWh")

# 4. Let people decide what to do with that information
