Coupling from Physics: the interior optimum, derived rather than asserted

The framework claims f(C) peaks at intermediate coupling — "too weak =
fragmented, too strong = rigid." Until now that claim was implemented as
a Gaussian bump around a chosen C*, which is an assertion dressed as a
measurement: change C* and the optimum moves wherever you put it.

Synchronization theory derives the same shape from the dynamics, with no
free aesthetic parameter. For N units with identical dynamics coupled
through a network, the Master Stability Function (Pecora & Carroll 1998,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 80:2109) reduces stability of the synchronous state to a
single scalar condition. Writing the network's Laplacian eigenvalues as
0 = lambda_1 <= lambda_2 <= ... <= lambda_N and the coupling strength as
sigma, the synchronous state is stable exactly when every scaled
eigenvalue lands inside the MSF's negative region:

    nu_1 < sigma * lambda_i < nu_2        for i = 2 .. N

Huang, Chen, Lai & Pecora (2009, Phys. Rev. E 80:036204) show that only
three classes of behaviour are possible for any pair of node dynamics and
coupling function:

    Class I   — the MSF never goes negative. No coupling strength
                synchronizes. There is no optimum because there is no
                stable region at all.
    Class II  — one crossing, at nu_1. Stable for every sigma above a
                threshold. Physics gives a threshold, not an optimum:
                more coupling is never worse.
    Class III — two crossings, nu_1 and nu_2. Stable only inside a
                bounded window. Too little coupling and the slowest mode
                (lambda_2) never locks; too much and the fastest mode
                (lambda_N) is driven unstable.

**Class III is where the framework's interior optimum actually comes
from, and it is a property of the node dynamics — not a universal law.**
Asserting an interior optimum for a Class II system would be inventing a
penalty physics does not impose. This module reports the class rather
than assuming one.

TWO CONSEQUENCES WORTH THE SPACE
--------------------------------
1. **Fragmentation is structural, not a tuning error.** A disconnected
   network has lambda_2 = 0, so no sigma satisfies the lower bound. "Too
   weak = fragmented" is not a statement about turning coupling down far
   enough; it is a statement that the network has no path.

2. **Some networks cannot be fixed by tuning at all.** Both bounds are
   satisfiable simultaneously only when

       lambda_N / lambda_2  <  nu_2 / nu_1

   the eigenratio criterion (Barahona & Pecora 2002, Phys. Rev. Lett.
   89:054101). The left side is pure topology; the right side is pure
   dynamics. If the network's eigenratio exceeds the dynamics' window,
   *no* coupling strength works and the only remedy is changing the
   network. Lower eigenratio = more synchronizable.

MEASUREMENT, NOT CONTROL
------------------------
Reporting that a network sits outside its synchronization window is not
an instruction to retune it. Plenty of real systems should not be
synchronized at all, and a high eigenratio is sometimes exactly what
keeps a failure local.
