## What This Does

Measures systemic health through coherence metrics integrated with energy accounting.

**This framework MEASURES reality. It does NOT control systems.**

### Core Measurement

```python
M(S) = (R_e × A × D × f(C)) - L

Where:
- R_e: Resonance energy (constructive interaction)
- A: Adaptability (recovery rate)
- D: Diversity (viable strategies)
- f(C): Coupling function (optimal at intermediate)
- L: Loss/entropy rate


Value = M(S) / Energy_Cost

Examples:
- Efficient rural worker: HIGH M(S) / 6 kWh = Maximum value
- Billionaire executive: NEGATIVE M(S) / 1000 kWh = Massive waste


🎯 Use Cases
✅ Truth-Telling (Good)
	•	Prove who creates actual value
	•	Calculate true replacement costs
	•	Show which collaboration patterns work
	•	Reveal hidden energy costs
❌ Control (Bad)
	•	Optimize populations toward metric
	•	Enforce conformity to “coherence”
	•	Apply interventions without consent
	•	Social engineering
Quick Start

from mcpm import CoherenceMetric, EnergyIntegration

# Measure system coherence
system = load_your_system_data()
metric = CoherenceMetric()

M_S = metric.calculate(
    resonance_energy=system.R_e,
    adaptability=system.A,
    diversity=system.D,
    coupling_matrix=system.C,
    loss_rate=system.L
)

# Calculate efficiency
energy = EnergyIntegration()
efficiency = M_S / energy.total_cost(system)

print(f"System coherence: {M_S:.2f}")
print(f"Energy cost: {energy.total_cost(system):.2f} kWh/day")
print(f"Efficiency ratio: {efficiency:.4f}")

⚠️ Important Distinctions
This Framework Is:
	•	📊 A measurement tool (reveals truth)
	•	🔬 A diagnostic system (shows health)
	•	📈 An efficiency calculator (proves value)
	•	🌱 A pattern descriptor (how collaboration emerges)
This Framework Is NOT:
	•	❌ A control system (doesn’t enforce)
	•	❌ An optimization target (doesn’t prescribe)
	•	❌ A social engineering tool (doesn’t manipulate)
	•	❌ An intervention system (doesn’t force)
Measure reality. Don’t enforce ideology.

Key principle: All contributions must preserve measurement focus, never add control mechanisms.

“Energy accounting proves WHO is efficient. Geometric morality proves HOW to collaborate. Together: Complete truth-telling.”
