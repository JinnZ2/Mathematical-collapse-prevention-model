## What This Does

Measures systemic health through coherence metrics integrated with energy accounting.

**This framework MEASURES reality. It does NOT control systems.**

### Core Measurement

```python
M(S) = (R_e × A × D × f(C)) - L

Where:
- R_e: Resonance energy (constructive interaction)
- A: Adaptability (recovery rate)
- D: Diversity (viable strategies)
- f(C): Coupling function (optimal at intermediate)
- L: Loss/entropy rate
